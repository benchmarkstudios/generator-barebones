> Built on [Barebones](https://github.com/benchmarkstudios/barebones), a lightweight, skeletal, responsive WordPress boilerplate theme for HTML5 and beyond. Great as a starting point with powerful features to encourage rapid development for most projects.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# watch
gulp watch

# build for production with minification
gulp --production

```
